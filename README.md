# MaterialCalendarViewDemo

Android Material Calendar View Demo

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Material Calendar View Demo' app icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a large calander which is shown in month long view. The user can easily flip though the various months
by using the left of right arrows on the side of the month and date title. When the user clicks a date a Toast message pops up below
and tells them which date they selected. This demo uses the library maintained 
by <a href="https://github.com/prolificinteractive/material-calendarview">Prolific Interactive</a> to create the calendar effect.

Screen cap images and video of the app in use can be found on <a href="http://digitalmirko.com/javaApps.html">Digital Mirko</a>.
